# Eia64
Eia64 is an interpreted language that draws inspiration from the lovely syntax of Kotlin and many other languages like Go.

Look at asciinema recording [here](https://asciinema.org/a/666650).

Language is extensively documented at [Eia Docs](https://eia-docs.vercel.app/)

`/stdlib` is where the standard library of Eia is located, it supports `string`, `array` and some `math`.\
`/examples` are some really cool codes written in Eia 👀

## How to run

> Requires >= Java 11, to know your version run `java -version`

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XomaDev/Eia64
```

Usage of the Eia binary:

```
java -jar Eia64.jar [debug] live|source_file_path
```

### Live Mode

To enter into a live mode do `java -jar Eia64.jar live`

```kotlin
$ java -jar Eia64.jar live
> println("Hello, World!")
> ~~
Hello, World!
```

Type in the code in the terminal, to execute it type `~~` in a next line.\
Use `exit` to exit the terminal.

### Pass in a source file

`java -jar Eia64.jar <source_file>`

````kotlin
$ java -jar Eia64.jar examples/animation.eia
