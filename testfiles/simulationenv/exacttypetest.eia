; when we do not check the types deeply, it would be possible to pass a 'Girl' type to a man
; so a parser time verification is required to solve this


fn accept(man: Man) {
  println(man)
}

; after verifying the runtime type, we shall also need to verify the subtype of Object
accept(new Girl("Meow"))
