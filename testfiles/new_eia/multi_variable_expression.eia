; main note: for variables to be recognized as multi expr, they need to have ! mark
; or else it may collide with comma of for loop

; future adjustments
;  ';' must be swapped with // for comments
;  ';' must be repurposed for separating entities in for loop

; adding feat for declaring multiple variables in a single expression
let! a = 2, b = 23

; can contain more than 1 type
; this will be useful inside for() loop (initializer|conditional|operational    )
let! c: Int = 2, d: String = "meow"

println("Values: ")
println(a, b)
println(c, d)

println("Types: ")
println(typeOf(a), " ", typeOf(b))
println(typeOf(c), " ", typeOf(d))
